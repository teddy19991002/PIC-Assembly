; Main - When SW2 is pressed, the LED is toggled, and the debounce routine for SW2 is
;        initiated.  Debouncing a switch is necessary to prevent one button press from 
;        being read as more than one button press by the microcontroller.  A 
;        microcontroller can read a button so fast that contact jitter in the switch 
;        may be interpreted as more than one button press.
